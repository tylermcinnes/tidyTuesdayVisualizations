# tidyTuesdayVisualizations

tidytuesday is a community event based around data visualization, cleaning and exploration. 

I am in the process of planning and writing a one-day workshop on visualizations ("visualization day"). This workshop will focus on basic visualization syntax with ggplot2 in the morning, using visualizations for exploratory analysis in the middle of the day, and end with a session where users can visualize their own data. 

As preparation for this workshop, I will run through some tidytuesday dataset visualizations (first on my own, then working through community examples).
